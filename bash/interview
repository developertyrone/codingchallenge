Bash has many test commands to check if a file or directory exists or not and the type of the file. ‘-d’ option is used with a directory path as a conditional statement to check if the directory exists or not in bash.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
# Assign the directory with path in the variable, $path
path="/home/ubuntu/temp"
# Check the directory exists or not
if [ -d "$path" ]; then
   # Print message if the directory exists

else
   # Print message if the directory doesn’t exist
   echo "Directory not exists"
fi

The uses of the above commands are shown in the following script.

#!/bin/bash
# Count length using `expr` length option
echo `expr length "I like PHP"`
# Count length using `wc` command
echo "I like Bash" | wc -c
# Count length using `awk` command
echo "I like Python" | awk '{print length}'

50. How to run multiple bash script in parallel?
